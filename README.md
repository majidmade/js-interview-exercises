## About
This is a set of code exercises designed to test JavaScript knowledge, at varying degrees of difficulty.

## Usage
Check out a new branch with the date and your name in the following form:
    
    YY-MM-DD-Myname
   
For instance, I'm writing this on December 4th 2020, and my name is Majid, so I'd check out:
 
    20-12-04-Majid

(Alternatively, you are welcome to fork.)

When you're ready, navigate to the appropriate exercise under `./src/exercises`. 
There should be some instructions, a placeholder for implementation, and some tests.
Get your bearings, and then make the tests pass!

## Questions 

**Why did you use `create-react-app`?**
1. Currently these exercises focus on vanilla js, but they will likely be extended to cover React at some point.
2. It's fast and easy, and I'm dumb and lazy.
