## About
This is a set of code exercises designed to test JavaScript knowledge, at varying degrees of difficulty.

## Usage
Check out a new branch with the date and your name in the following form:
    
    YY-MM-DD-Myname
   
For instance, I'm writing this on December 4th 2020, and my name is Majid, so I'd check out:
 
    20-12-04-Majid

(Alternatively, you are welcome to fork.)

When you're ready, navigate to the appropriate exercise under `./src/exercises`. 
There should be some instructions, a placeholder for implementation, and some tests.
Get your bearings, and then make the tests pass!

## Q&A 

**How do I know the requirements for a given exercise?**

Run and/or read the relevant unit tests. Think of these as your product requirements.

**I didn't make all the tests pass in the allotted time! Is that bad?**

No, not necessarily. Depending on the exercise and allotted time, it may not be reasonable to make every test go green.
In these cases, think of it as an additional prioritization/time-management challenge.

For instance, you may want to get the the core functionality working before tackling edge cases.
Or, similarly, you may want to get everything working hackily before refactoring for quality.
Or maybe not! Use your judgment. 

**Do I have to use a particular IDE?**

No, use whatever tools you're comfortable with.

**Can I use Google/StackOverflow/etc.?**

Yes, see previous. This is intended to be a real-world exercise, not some abstract whiteboard test.

**Why did you use `create-react-app`?**

1. Currently these exercises focus on vanilla js, but they will likely be extended to cover React at some point.
2. It's fast and easy, and I'm dumb and lazy.

**Can I contribute an exercise?**

Sure! PRs welcome.
